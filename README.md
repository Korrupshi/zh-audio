"# zh-audio" 

## Bugs:
**1. Converting using ffmpeg is too slow, is there a way to save directly as AAC or MP3 using Java?**
- Audio gets trimmed in seconds, this means the sentences get cut short: 

## TODO:
**Can i insta download TTS for words missing?**
- Use info for language used during download
- Add catches at downloader if there is no audio or subtitles file
- For taiwanese videos, add another language to ytdlp
    - Also convert trad-to-simp
